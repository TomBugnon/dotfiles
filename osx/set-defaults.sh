# My version of https://raw.github.com/holman/dotfiles/master/osx/set-defaults.sh:

# Sets reasonable OS X defaults.
#
# Or, in other words, set shit how I like in OS X.
#
# The original idea (and a couple settings) were grabbed from:
#   https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.osx
#
# Run ./set-defaults.sh and you'll be good to go.

# Disable press-and-hold for keys in favor of key repeat.
defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false

# Use AirDrop over every interface. srsly this should be a default.
defaults write com.apple.NetworkBrowser BrowseAllInterfaces 1

# Fast key repeat
defaults write NSGlobalDomain KeyRepeat -int 0
